ðŸ’¡ Insurance Charges Prediction App

This project predicts medical insurance charges based on a few key factors like age, BMI, and smoking status. It uses a machine learning model trained on the popular insurance.csv dataset and provides a simple Streamlit web app where users can interactively test predictions.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Interactive UI built with Streamlit

Input fields for Age, BMI, and Smoker/Non-Smoker

Real-time prediction of insurance charges using a pre-trained model

Clean and minimal interface for easy use

ðŸ”¹ Files Included

insurance.csv â€“ Dataset used for training

Insurance.ipynb â€“ Notebook with data analysis and model training
